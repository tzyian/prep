# End-to-End Flow: Web Request from Browser to Server


Let's walk through **every step** in detail, from a user typing a URL in their browser to receiving a web page, focusing on the application, transport, and network layers, including DNS resolution, packet encapsulation, router internals, and socket delivery.

***

## 1. Application Layer: User Request \& DNS Resolution

- **User types URL** (e.g., `http://www.example.com`) in the browser.
- **Browser extracts hostname** (`www.example.com`).
- **Local DNS cache checked** for the IP address.
- **If not cached:**
    - The browser's DNS resolver creates a DNS query message: "What is the IP of www.example.com?"
    - **Encapsulation begins:**
        - DNS query message is wrapped in a UDP segment (source port: ephemeral, destination port: 53).
        - UDP segment is wrapped in an IP datagram (source IP: client, destination IP: DNS server).
        - IP datagram is wrapped in a link-layer frame (Ethernet/Wi-Fi) and sent over the physical medium.
- **DNS query sent to local DNS server.**
- **If local server doesn't know:**
    - It recursively queries:
        - One of the 13 **root DNS servers** for TLD info (e.g., `.com`, `.gov`).
        - The root server refers the query to the appropriate **TLD DNS server** (e.g., `.com`).
        - The TLD server refers the query to the **authoritative DNS server** for `example.com`.
        - The authoritative server returns the IP address for `www.example.com`.
- **DNS response traverses back** to the resolver and client; result is cached locally.

***

## 2. Transport Layer: UDP and TCP

### DNS Queries (UDP)

- **DNS query/response** fits inside UDP segments (connectionless, no handshake).
	- **UDP header**: Source port (ephemeral), destination port 53 (DNS).
- **UDP segment** is encapsulated in an IP datagram.
	- **IP header**: Source IP (client), destination IP (DNS server), protocol field set to UDP, TTL, checksum.
- **Routers forward** the IP datagram hop-by-hop using destination IP address and longest prefix match.
- **Router internals:**
    - Input port receives link-layer frame, strips link header (unwrapping).
    - IP datagram header is checked (TTL decremented, checksum recalculated).
    - Forwarding table lookup (longest prefix match) determines next hop.
    - Datagram switched through router fabric (crossbar, bus, or multistage switch).
    - Buffered if output port is busy (buffers manage congestion).
    - Datagram is re-encapsulated into output link-layer frame and sent.
- **At destination DNS server:**
	- **NIC:** Strips link-layer header, passes IP datagram to OS.
	- **Network layer:** OS strips IP header, passes UDP segment to transport layer.
	- **Transport layer:** OS strips UDP header, delivers DNS query to DNS server process via socket.
	- **Application layer:** DNS server process receives query, processes it, and prepares a response.
#### DNS Response (Reverse Path)

- **Who:** DNS server process, OS kernel, NIC
- **Wrapping:**
    - **Application:** DNS server creates response message.
    - **Transport:** OS wraps response in UDP segment (source port 53, dest port ephemeral).
    - **Network:** OS wraps UDP segment in IP datagram (source IP: DNS server, dest IP: client).
    - **Link:** NIC wraps IP datagram in link-layer frame (MAC addresses).
    - **Physical:** Frame sent over medium.
- **At each router:** Same unwrapping/wrapping as above, until it reaches the client.
- **At client:** NIC, OS, and DNS client process unwrap each layer in turn, finally delivering the IP address to the browser.


### TCP Connection \& Data Transfer

- **Once IP address is resolved:**
    - Browser initiates a TCP connection to the server IP on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).
    - **TCP three-way handshake:**
        - Client sends TCP SYN segment to server.
        - Server replies with TCP SYN-ACK segment.
        - Client sends TCP ACK segment.
        - Connection is established.
- **Browser sends HTTP GET request** inside TCP segment.
- **TCP ensures reliable, ordered delivery** with flow control and congestion control.
- **TCP segments** are encapsulated into IP datagrams.

***

## 3. Network Layer: IP Datagram and Routing

- **TCP segments are wrapped in IP datagrams.**
- **IP datagrams are forwarded hop-by-hop** through the network:
    - Each router performs **longest prefix matching** on the destination IP address using its forwarding table.
    - **Router internals:**
        - Input port receives link-layer frame, strips link header (unwrapping).
        - IP datagram header is checked (TTL decremented, checksum recalculated).
        - **Forwarding table** lookup (longest prefix match) determines output port.
        - Datagram switched through internal router fabric (crossbar, bus, or multistage switch).
        - Buffered if output port is busy (buffers manage congestion and prevent losses).
        - Datagram is re-encapsulated into output link-layer frame and sent.
- **Datagram travels through various subnets and routers globally** until it reaches the serverâ€™s subnet.
- **Final router delivers the IP datagram** to the destination host in the subnet.

## Link Layer (Ethernet/Wi-Fi)
- **Who:** Network Interface Card (NIC) hardware/driver
- **Action:** The IP datagram is wrapped in a link-layer frame (e.g., Ethernet frame).
    - **Link header**: Source MAC, destination MAC (usually router's MAC for first hop), error detection bits (CRC).
- **Wrapping:** NIC hardware/driver adds link header/trailer, sends frame over the physical medium.

***

## 4. Host and Socket Layer

- **Destination host receives the link-layer frame.**
- **Link-layer frame is decapsulated** to reveal the IP datagram.
- **IP datagram header is stripped** to reveal the TCP segment.
- **TCP uses the socket 4-tuple** (source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port) to demultiplex the segment to the correct socket associated with the web server process.
- **TCP layer processes segments, reassembles data, and provides reliable in-order delivery** to the application.
- **Web server application receives the HTTP request** and processes it.
- **HTTP response is sent back** inside TCP segments, following the reverse encapsulation path.

## 6. Router Internals, Subnets, and Routing Algorithms

- **Routers connect multiple subnets** (network segments with no intervening routers).
- **Forwarding table** in each router is built by control plane protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP).
- **Packet forwarding:**
    - Input port receives frame, strips link-layer header.
    - IP datagram buffered at input queue.
    - Forwarding decision made using destination IP and longest prefix match.
    - Packet switched across internal fabric (crossbar, bus, or multistage switch).
    - Output buffers queue packets if necessary.
    - Output port wraps datagram in link-layer frame for next hop.
- **Subnets:**
    - Devices within a subnet communicate directly (no router needed).
    - Routers forward packets between subnets.

## 10. Key Concepts Recap

- **Encapsulation:** Each layer wraps the data from the layer above with its own header.
- **Decapsulation:** Each layer at the receiver strips its own header to reveal the data for the layer above.
- **Router fabric:** Internal switching mechanism moves packets from input to output ports, with buffering to handle congestion.
- **Longest prefix match:** Routers use this algorithm to forward packets based on destination IP address.
- **Sockets:** Identified by 4-tuple (src IP, src port, dest IP, dest port), used for demultiplexing at the transport layer.
- **Subnets:** Network segments where devices communicate directly; routers connect different subnets.
- **DNS uses UDP, web data uses TCP.**
- **Every hop involves wrapping/unwrapping at link and network layers.**
