### User Threads vs Kernel Threads vs Hybrid Threads

#### 1. User Threads
- **Definition**: Threads implemented entirely in **user space** (managed by a runtime library, not the OS kernel).
- **Scheduling**: Done by the user-level thread library (e.g., `pthreads` in pure user mode).
- **OS visibility**: Kernel sees only the **process**, not its user threads.
- **Context switch**: Fast (no kernel mode switch).
- **Blocking issue**: If one thread performs a blocking syscall, the **whole process blocks**.
- **Example systems**: Early Java Green Threads, GNU Portable Threads.

**Pros**:
- Very fast thread creation/switching (no kernel involvement).
- Portable across OSes.

**Cons**:
- Cannot leverage multiple CPUs (kernel only sees one process).
- One blocking syscall blocks all threads.

#### 2. Kernel Threads
- **Definition**: Threads managed directly by the **OS kernel**.
- **Scheduling**: Kernel schedules each thread individually.
- **OS visibility**: Kernel is aware of every thread.
- **Context switch**: More expensive (requires kernel mode).
- **Blocking**: If one thread blocks, others can still run (on same or different CPUs).
- **Example systems**: Linux (NPTL), Windows threads.

**Pros**:
- True parallelism across CPUs.
- Blocking syscalls only affect one thread.

**Cons**:
- Higher overhead (creation, context switching).
- Kernel involvement makes them heavier.

#### 3. Hybrid Threads (M:N Model)
- **Definition**: Combines user and kernel threads.
  - **M user threads** are mapped onto **N kernel threads**.
- **Scheduling**:
  - User-level scheduler maps threads to kernel threads.
  - Kernel schedules kernel threads on CPUs.
- **Goal**: Best of both worlds (fast user switching + kernel-level parallelism).
- **Example systems**: Solaris threads, some versions of Windows Fibers, GNU Scheduler Activations (research).

**Pros**:
- More efficient than pure kernel threads (lighter weight).
- Can exploit multiple CPUs.
- Flexible (user library decides mapping).

**Cons**:
- Complex implementation.
- Synchronization between user scheduler and kernel scheduler can be tricky.

#### Analogy
- **User threads**: Like actors in a play managed by a director who only rents **one stage** → actors take turns but can’t perform in parallel.  
- **Kernel threads**: Each actor gets their own stage from the theater manager → true parallelism, but booking stages is costly.  
- **Hybrid threads**: A director manages actors and negotiates with the theater manager for multiple stages → balance of efficiency and flexibility.
