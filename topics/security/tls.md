# TLS (Transport Layer Security)

## 1. Purpose
TLS provides:
- **Confidentiality** â†’ Encrypts traffic.  
- **Integrity** â†’ Detects tampering.  
- **Authentication** â†’ Verifies server identity (and sometimes client).

## 2. TLS Handshake (Simplified)

1. Server sends its **certificate** (contains its public key + CA signature).
2. Browser checks the certificate chain back to a trusted CA.
3. Browser uses the serverâ€™s **public key** to verify the TLS handshake (RSA/ECDHE).
4. If valid, they agree on a **symmetric session key (AES)** for fast encrypted communication.

## 3. Whatâ€™s in a TLS Certificate?

TLS certificates are **X.509** structures. Common fields:
- **Subject**: Domain name (e.g., `www.example.com`).
- **Issuer**: Certificate Authority (CA) that signed it.
- **Public Key**: Serverâ€™s asymmetric key (RSA/ECDSA).
- **Validity Period**: Start/end date.
- **Extensions**:
  - Subject Alternative Names (SANs): multiple domains.
  - Key Usage (signing, encryption).
- **Signature**: CAâ€™s digital signature over the certificate contents.

A public key in a website needs to be certified so
- **so we know this server is really example.com**
- A certificate is validated by a trusted CA or a chain of trusted CA
- Trusted CAs are cached in the browser/OS, 
- The first CA is manually configured

    Note over C,S: ðŸ”‘ Asymmetric phase (Authentication & Key Exchange)

    C->>S: ClientHello<br/>(supported versions, cipher suites, client random,<br/>ECDHE public key)
    S->>C: ServerHello<br/>(chosen version/cipher, server random,<br/>ECDHE public key)
    S->>C: Certificate (X.509 with public key, signed by CA)
    S->>CA: Certificate Signature Verification
    CA->>S: Valid (server identity confirmed)
    S->>C: CertificateVerify<br/>(digital signature using serverâ€™s private key)
    S->>C: Finished (prove handshake integrity)

    Note over C,S: ðŸ”’ Both sides derive same symmetric session key<br/>via ECDHE key exchange + randoms

    C->>S: Finished (prove handshake integrity)

    Note over C,S: âš¡ Symmetric phase begins (Bulk encryption)<br/>AES-GCM or ChaCha20 used for application data
    C->>S: Application Data (encrypted)
    S->>C: Application Data (encrypted)
