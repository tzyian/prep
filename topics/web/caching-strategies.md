# Question Card: Caching Strategies

Cache aside  (lazy load)
Read through (cache reads db)
Write through (write to both cache and db)
Write behind (cache async write to db)
Write around (write to db, only fetch cache)

- Question: Compare caching strategies (write-through, write-back, cache-aside). When to use which?
- Role: backend
- Difficulty: mid

## Short Answer
Cache-aside keeps source of truth in DB; app loads into cache on miss and invalidates/updates on write. Write-through writes to cache and DB synchronously. Write-back buffers writes in cache and flushes later. Use cache-aside for general app caching, write-through for simplicity/consistency, and write-back for high write throughput with acceptable risk.

## Deep Dive
- Eviction: LRU/LFU/TTL; stampede protection (locks/jittered TTL).
- Consistency: invalidate on change, version keys, or publish/subscribe.
- Topology: client‑side vs service‑side cache; CDNs for edge.

## Example
```text
Cache-aside read: GET k -> miss -> DB -> set k (TTL)
```

## Follow‑ups
- Negative caching and TTL selection.
- Hot keys, sharding, and replication.

## Pitfalls
- Thundering herd on popular expirations.
- Inconsistent invalidations leading to stale reads.

## Checklist
- Strategy choice · TTL/eviction · stampede protection · invalidation path
